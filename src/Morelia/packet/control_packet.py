class ControlPacket(PodPacket):
    """Class for parsing "Standard" POD packets from raw bytes. These are associated with controlling or configuring a device, hence the name
       These packets take the following form:

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       | 0x02 (1 byte) | command number (4 ascii-encoded bytes) | payload (variable even number of ascii-encoded bytes) | checksum (2 bytes) | 0x03 (1 byte) |
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       The payload is normally several values that need to parsed into a tuple of integers.

       Oftentimes, this class is used a "factory" of sorts. For any given device, you might partially apply the constructor with the
       `decode_from` argument, and then any time you need to make a packet, just call the curried constructor with
       the raw bytes of the packet you want to parse. For a concrete example of this, see the constructor of the `Pod8206HR` class.

       :param decode_from: Instructs the packet how to parse the payload from raw bytes to a Python object. If a `CommandSet` object is passed,
       the payload is decoded according to that. Otherwise, a function must be passed that takes a command number and `bytes` object to decode,
       and returns a `tuple`. For a simple example of how passing a `decode_from` function directly may be used,
       see the constructor of the `Pod8206HR` class.
