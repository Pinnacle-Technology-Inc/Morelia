class DataPacket8274D(DataPacket):
    '''
    This class handles decoding 8274D data packets. On a binary level, data 
    packets for the 8206HR look as follows:

    .. image:: _static/data_packet_8274D.png


    The raw packet and several values from the device (with the same names as the parameters)
    needed for calculations are passed to the constructor. Outside
    of testing, users should never be instantiating this class directly,
    that should be limited to instances of the ``Pod8274D`` class.

    :param raw_packet: Raw bytes of packet read from device.
    :primary_gain: Desired primary gain. Use 100 for 8274-SL, 8274-SE, 8274-SE3, and 8274-E
    :secondary_gain: Desired secondary gain. Use 26 for 8274-SL, 8274-SE, and 8274-SE3. Use 13 for 8274-E.
