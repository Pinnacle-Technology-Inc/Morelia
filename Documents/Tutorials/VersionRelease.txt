1. Merge all feature branches (i.e. [PA-##]) into the develop branch. 

2. Ensure that all classes, and methods have been correctly documented using Google style docstrings. 

3. Update all appropriate class diagrams. Save a *.drawio and *.png version.

4. Update the README.md with any changes

5. Update Sphinx:
        1. Open Morelia\pyproject.toml. Edit line 3 with current verion number (i.e. ''' version = "v1.6.1" ''').
        2. Open Morelia\SphinxDocs\conf.py. Edit line 15 with current version number (i.e. ''' release = 'v1.6.1' ''')
        3. Enter python enviornment: i.e. 
            >>  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
            >>  & C:/git/Morelia/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
        4. Go to Morelia directory: i.e. 
            >>  cd C:\git\Morelia
        5. Delete old Sphinx files:
            >>  cd .\SphinxDocs\
            >>  .\make clean 
        6. Add new python modules as Sphinx *.rst files:
            >> cd C:\git\Morelia
            >> sphinx-apidoc -o .\SphinxDocs .\Code\
                    This will output the following:
                        File .\SphinxDocs\PodApi.rst already exists, skipping.
                        File .\SphinxDocs\PodApi.Commands.rst already exists, skipping.
                        ...
        7. Open the *.rst files to check that all modules and sub-modules have been added. 
            NOTE: if the *.rst already exists, it may not update with new classes. You can delete the 
            module *.rst file and then try step #7 again. 
        8. Make the new Sphinx docs
            >>  cd .\SphinxDocs\
            >>  .\make html
            >>  .\make latex

6. Update the PDF manual using the Sphinx LaTeX output: Morelia\SphinxDocs\_build\latex. I do this by... 
        1. making a copy of Morelia\SphinxDocs\_build\latex and compressing it to a *.zip file. 
        2. Open LaTeX Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/project), click New Project > Upload Project, and then upload the *.zip. 
        3. Open the Overleaf project and compile pythonpodapi.tex. 
        4. Then download the PDF. Rename the file as Python_POD_API_Manual.pdf
        5. Upload the Python_POD_API_Manual.pdf to GitHub here: \Morelia\Documents\API_Manuals\

7. Merge the develop branch into integration

8. Update the ReadTheDocs webpage
        1. Log into to ReadTheDocs and go to the Python POD API project: https://readthedocs.org/projects/Morelia/
        2. Click "Build Version". This will read the files in Morelia\SphinxDocs\_build\latex from the integration branch 
            and will create an html webpage. 
        3. After it is finished building, open the ReadTheDocs Python POD API documentation documentation page and
            verify that it is up to date: https://Morelia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

9. Publish a new version release on GitHub 
        1. Log in to GitHub and open the Python Pod API project: https://github.com/Pinnacle-Technology-Inc/Morelia
        2. Click "Releases" on the right side of the page. 
        3. Click "Draft a new release"
        4. Click "Choose a tag" and create a new version tag (i.e. v1.5.4)
        5. Keep the Target as integration
        6. Add a short descriptive release title 
        7. Write a summary of all added featrues and bug fixes. i.e.
                ### Update Summary
                1. Removed miscellaneous text output. 
                2. Fixed check for serial port
                3. Fixed Stream module to save data to EDF file.
        8. Uncheck "Set as a pre-release", check "Set as the latest release", and check "Create a discussion for this release".
        9. Click "Publish Release"

10. Update the new version release in JIRA
        1. Make a new version entry in JIRA with status UNRELEASED if it does not already exist.
        2. Add all appropriate issues to this version (stories, bugs, tasks, epics, etc.).
        3. Change version JIRA status to RELEASE and set the appropriate release data. This version will now appear
            on the calendar and timeline.
