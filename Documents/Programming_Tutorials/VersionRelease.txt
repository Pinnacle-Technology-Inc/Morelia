. Merge all feature branches (i.e. [PA-##]) into the develop branch. 
. Ensure that all classes, and methods have been correctly documented using Google style docstrings. 
. Update all approptriate class diagrams
. Update the README.md with any changes
. Update Sphinx (see steps below)

        Steps for updating Sphinx for a new version releases: 

        1. Open Python-POD-API\SphinxDocs\conf.py
        2. Edit line 15 with current version number (i.e. ''' release = 'v1.6.0' ''')
        3. Save and close conf.py
        4. Enter python enviornment: i.e. 
            >>  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
            >>  & C:/git/Python-POD-API/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
        5. Go to Python-POD-API directory: i.e. 
            >>  cd C:\git\Python-POD-API
        6. Delete old Sphinx files:
            >>  cd .\SphinxDocs\
            >>  .\make clean 
        7. Add new python modules as Sphinx *.rst files:
            >> cd C:\git\Python-POD-API
            >> sphinx-apidoc -o .\SphinxDocs .\Code\
                    This will output the following:
                        File .\SphinxDocs\PodApi.rst already exists, skipping.
                        File .\SphinxDocs\PodApi.Commands.rst already exists, skipping.
                        ...
        8. Open the *.rst files to check that all modules and sub-modules have been added. 
            NOTE: if the *.rst already exists, it may not update with new classes. You can delete the 
            module *.rst file and then try step #7 again. 
        9. Make the new Sphinx docs
            >>  cd .\SphinxDocs\
            >>  .\make html
            >>  .\make latex

. Make a PDF manual using the Sphinx LaTeX output. I do this by making a copy of 
Python-POD-API\SphinxDocs\_build\latex and compressing it to a *.zip file. I then open LaTeX Overleaf 
(https://www.overleaf.com/project), click New Project > Upload Project, and then upload the *.zip. Open 
the project and compile pythonpodapi.tex. Then download the PDF. Rename the downloaded file as
Python_POD_API_Manual.pdf
. Upload the Python_POD_API_Manual.pdf to GitHub here: \Python-POD-API\Documents\API_Manuals\


For internal version releases:

. Make a new version entry in JIRA with status UNRELEASED
. Add all new issues to this version.
