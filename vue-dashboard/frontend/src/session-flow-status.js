// Collapses the independent signals the detail page receives into the one
// question an operator asks while spectating a run: is data moving, and should I

//
//   lifecycle       — what the control plane intends (Preparing..Completed)
//   health          — the backend's session-level rollup over the streams
//   streams         — the RAW per-device stream states from the newest report
//   outboxHealth    — whether the runtime is still reporting at all
//   activityState   — whether OUR event stream is connected (session-events.js)
//
// Two of these are subtle:
//
// `activityState` — a dead SSE connection means we cannot SEE the session, not
// that the session stopped. Reporting that as red would train operators to
// ignore red. It caps at amber and says so in `reason`.
//
// `streams` vs `health` — `health` is the backend's cross-axis rollup
// (health_state.derive), and it is lossy on purpose: a single enum cannot show
// two axes at once. Relying on it alone is what made this bar report "Streaming"
// while a pod sat unplugged. The per-device states are carried alongside it, NOT
// folded into it, so the rail can show which stream and why.

/**
 * Tone + copy for one sink group, as its own axis.
 *
 * Kept separate from the stream tone rather than merged into it, because the
 * two failures need different responses: a dead stream means the device stopped
 * producing, while a failed sink means the device is fine and the write path is
 * losing it. Merging them would make those look identical on the rail.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NOT A FAULT on this axis. The runtime populates a report's `sinks`
 * list from the sink-ERROR queue alone (`Morelia._drain_sink_errors`), so a
 * healthy sink is never mentioned and `_sink_status_view` necessarily stamps it
 * `stale` — "known only from durable evidence". Reading that as unproven pinned
 * every healthy row to amber under a green session and printed
 * "N not in latest report" forever. Under the contract the runtime actually
 * implements, silence about a sink is the good news.
 *
 * Only evidence moves this axis off neutral:
 *   - a live `health` of degraded/failed,
 *   - `status: "unknown"`, which is the backend's parse-FAILURE marker (a live
 *     snapshot arrived and could not be read) and not the same as absence,
 *   - durable `sample_loss`, which is monotonic and outlives the report.
