The Hitchhiker's Guide to Morelia 🐍
====================================

Welcome to the getting started guide for Pinnacle Technology's Python API: Morelia. This tutorial is meant for complete beginners,
and only assumes basic Python programming skills. If you have not used Python before, or simply need to refresher, `the official
Python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_ is a good place to start. In terms of content, this guide contains:

* Environment Setup 
* Installation
* Connecting to Devices
* Device Configuration
* Harnessing Data Acquisition Systems
* Controlling a Sleep Deprivation System
* Wielding a Stimulus Controller

What's in a Name? 🌹
--------------------

At Pinnacle, it's a bit of a tradition to name our products after animals. Since Morelia is written in
Python, we decided to name it after a `genus of pythons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morelia_(snake)>`_. 😁🐍
