Streaming in Morelia takes the form of defining and executing data-flow graphs. Each data-flow
graph (in Morelia) consists of three parts:

* A collection of data **sources**.
* A collection of data **sinks**.
* A **mapping** that defines the flow of data between sources and sinks.

Let's expand on each of those concepts.

A **data source** (or more simply *source*) is anything that supplies :doc:`POD data packets </Morelia.packet.data>`. For almost all use-cases, this will be a
data aquisition device such as an 8206HR, 8401HR, or 8274D.

A **data sink** (oftentimes just called a *sink*), is a place to you want to send data. Some examples of this are EDF files, PVFS files, or even
a time-series database like InfluxDB.

We then relate sources to sinks via a one-to-many mapping with following constraint: A source can map to many sinks, but a sink can only map
to exactly **one** source. In more mathematical terms, it is an *injective* mapping.

To shed some more light on this, let us view an example data-flow graph.
